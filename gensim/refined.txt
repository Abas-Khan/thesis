Chromosomal basis of the merozygosity in a partially deploid mutant of Pneumococcus.A sulfonamide-resistant mutant pneumococcus, sulr-c, displays genetic instability, regularly segregating wild type. DNA extracts derivatives strain possess transforming activities mutant wild-type alleles, establishing strain partial diploid. The linkage sulr-c strr-61, stable chromosomal marker, established, thus defining chromosomal locus sulr-c. DNA isolated sulr-c cells transforms two mutant recipient strains low efficiency wild-type recipient, although mutant property strains makes capable integrating classical "low-efficiency" donor markers equally efficiently "high efficiency" markers. Hence sulr-c must different basis low efficiency classical low efficiency point mutations. We suggest DNA region sulr-c mutation structural abnormality leads frequent segregation growth difficulty efficiently mediating genetic transformation
Recombination as a requirement for segregation of a partially diploid mutant of Pneumococcus.Conditions described pneumococcal mutant strain sulr-c, resistant drug sulfanilamide, gives rise sensitive segregants resistant nitrobenzoic acid frequency constant time. This segregant frequency markedly enhanced upon exposure cells doses ultraviolet light mitomycin C permit survival 50% 90% cells. Treatment acridine orange diminishes segregant frequency. From known influences three agents genetic recombination, propose recombination event necessary generation segregants.--During period incubation following treatment ultraviolet light mitomycin C, cell division resumes original segregant frequency restored. Thus potential segregants either unable replicate absence selection, under-represented among cells dividing soon treatment.--If sulr-c mutation introduced mutant pneumococcal strain lacking ATP-dependent exonuclease activity deficient recombination transforming DNA, segregant frequencies unaffected. This fact may indicate limits upon type recombination event responsible segregation

X-ray crystallography normal human hemoglobin shown beta 2 residue normally part binding site 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The substitution arginine histidine beta 2 affects kinetics equilibria ligand binding. When stripped anions, Hb Deer Lodge increased oxygen affinity decreased degree cooperativity relative Hb A. The alkaline Bohr effect slightly increased marked increases oxygen affinity pH 6 pH 8. In presence 2,3-diphosphoglycerate cooperativity increases nromal pH dependence oxygen binding reduced. This contrasts enhanced Bohr effect seen Hb A presence organic phosphates. Due enhanced anion binding high pH, Hb Deer Lodge slightly lower oxygen affinity Hb A pH 9 presence 2,3-diphosphoglycerate inositol hexaphosphate. Kinetic studies neutral pH absence organic phosphates revealed biphasicity rate oxygen dissociation Hb Deer Lodge, approximately linear time courses observed Hb A. The fast phase oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, organic phosphates increase rate percentage fast phase without greatly affecting slow phase. The two phases resolvable high pH. CO combination kinetics much like Hb A except "fast" "slow" phases apparent wavelengths near deoxy-CO isobestic point. We suggest functional differences alpha beta chains enhanced Hb Deer Lodge. After flash photolysis CO derivative, percentage quickly reacting material slightly greater Hb Deer Lodge Hb A. This may imply somewhat greater tendency dissociate high affinity subunits. The substitution arginine histidine beta 2 thus results macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties significantly altered, primary differences expressed high pH Hb Deer Lodge binds anions strongly Hb A. The properties Hb Deer Lodge compared hemoglobin variants substitutions residues involved binding 2,3-diphosphoglycerate

We found four types lipolytic activities human platelets. In homogenates pH 4.0 triglyceride lipase operated shown synchrony triglyceride degradation release glycerol fatty acids predominant constituents triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid released pH level suggest phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts acid. With membranous preparations, alkaline pH range two peaks fatty acid release accompanying degradation phospholipids. At pH 8.5, release saturated acids, palmitic stearic, predominated, sum 3.5 times arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 release palmitic stearic acids slightly peak values; however, release arachidonic acid nearly equaled sum saturated acids. Linoleic acid released representative amounts reactions released arachidonic acid, despite overwhelming propensity esterified 2-position phospholipids. Pertinently, choline phospholipids linoleic-rich non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, generous endowment arachidonic acid. With mind, raise possibility phospholipase A2 human platelets endoenzyme tendency act phospholipids thought comprise inner layer cell membrane

Photoreceptor processes: some problems and perspectives.Visual photoreceptors vertebrates invertebrates characterized extensive elaboration membrane contains visual pigment rhodopsin. Visual pigments phyla examined chemically similar: chromophore 11-cis retinaldehyde attached aldimine linkage Schiff base membrane protein, opsin. The effect light isomerize chromophore all-trans configuration. Beyond fundamental similarities, several specific areas discussed variations differences appear. 1 Light causes vertebrate visual pigments bleach, liberating chromophore. Most invertebrate visual pigments bleach light, instead form thermally stable metarhodopsin, chromophore all-trans configuration still attached opsin. 2 In disk membranes vertebrate rod cone outer segments, rhodopsin molecules oriented chromophores nearly coplanar disks. Within plane, however, rotational translational diffusion possible. In microvillar membranes arthropod cephalopod rhabdoms, hand, situation less clear. There evidence preferential orientation chromophores implies restrictions Brownian rotation. 3 In outer segments vertebrate receptors, absorption light rhodopsin causes plasma membrane hyperpolarize due decrease sodium conductance, possibly mediated calcium ions. In invertebrate photoreceptors, light causes depolarization due increase conductance, principally sodium ions. A subsequent entry calcium causes partial repolarization membrane, due decrease sodium conductance. 4 For vertebrate receptors, log threshold directly proportional fraction rhodopsin bleached Dowling-Rushton relationship. The proportionality constant varies different preparations less four 30, physical basis relationship unknown. For invertebrates, contrast, dependence sensitivity rhodopsin concentration much less dramatic may well depend simply probability quantum catch. 5 In species, vertebrate invertebrate, accumulation photoproduct probably effect membrane conductance, several possible exceptions exist. 6 Photoregeneration rhodopsin metarhodopsin likely important mechanism recovery certain arthropods diurnal insects, dark mechanisms recovery also exist phyla.

Studies on the mechanism of depletion of striatal dopamine by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine.These experiments designed study mechanism depletion dopamine DA striatum produced alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine alpha-MMT. alpha-Methyl-m-tyramine alpha-MMTA, metabolite alpha-MMT, appears active DA-depleting agent, since administration decarboxylase inhibitor alpha-MMT markedly reduced formation alpha-MMTA depletion DA. After injection alpha-MMT 100 mg/kg i.p., striatal concentration homovanillic acid HVA rose 41% 1 hour. This probably due increase DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced decline DA produced alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine alpha-MPT. At 2, 3 4 hours alpha-MMT, concentration HVA dihydroxyphenylacetic acid control level. The decrease dihydroxyphenylacetic acid due partially decreased formation dihydroxyphenylacetic acid DA. In striatal slices, alpha-MMT alpha-MMTA decreased formation 3H-H2O accumulation 3H-DA 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine. Alpha-MMT alter specific activity 3H-tyrosine release 3H-DA slices, inhibit activity tyrosine hydroxylase striatal homogenates low concentrations tyrosine 10 muM. Alpha-MMTA released newly synthesized exogenously accumulated 3H-DA striatal slices. At low concentrations alpha-MMTA, percent reduction 3H-H2O much greater percentage 3H-DA released medium. However, higher concentrations, inhibition 3H-H2O reached maximum 3H-DA release kept increasing. These results suggest inhibition tyrosine hydroxylase activity DA release storage sites alpha-MMTA may account depletion DA produced injection alpha-MMT

The influence of pH on equilibrium effects of tetrodotoxin on myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta.1. The experiments done single nodes Ranvier Rana esculenta. The effects tetrodotoxin H ions determined either reduction maximum rate rise, VA, action potentials evoked threshold stimuli voltage clamp decrease peak Na permeability, PNa. 2. With tetrodotoxin sample used throughout investigation equilibrium dissociation constant, KT, toxin-receptor reaction neutral pH determined 2-8 nM. Between 1-55 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin normalized value, A, VA, found related normalized toxin concentration cT = TTX/2-8 nM empirical equation log 1-A/A = 1-22 log cT-0-573. 3. On increasing pH up 8-8 effect tetrodotoxin diminished revealed increase A. The apparent reduction cT as calculated A suggests toxin active cationic forms. 4. Weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions 7-3 less pH less equal 5-5 reduced A lesser degree neutral toxin solutions spite inherent depressing effect acid pH A A = 0-5 pH 5-5. In acid toxin solutions A decreased pH 4-6 equal value toxin-free solution. 5. When, equilibrium acid toxin solution, perfusate suddenly changed neutral Ringer solution A jumped higher value A measured 1 sec switch. Since blocking effect hydrogen ions subsided within fraction second time constant toxin washout order 1 min, A reflects number Na channels blocked tetrodotoxin acid pH. 6. In acid toxin-free solution peak PNa obtained voltage clamp experiments reduced voltage-dependent factor cH + 1-1 CH = H+/KHE KHE = 2-04 muM exp 0-34 EF/RT. Adding tetrodotoxin resulted another reduction constant factor pT. 7. Experiments employing various combinations toxin concentration 3-1-93 nM pH values 7-3-5-2 confirm decreased toxin effect low pH. Moreover, pT smaller the additional toxin effect larger membrane kept depolarized thus cH reduced equilibration. This suggests tetrodotoxin cations H ions compete blocking site. A quantitative fit, however, requires additional assumptions

Population growth-a menace to what?Originally, many initiators World Population Conference, took place Bucharest 1974, hoped Conference would imply final breakthrough view family planning measures given top priority less-developed countries. In fact, however, Plan Action passed Conference contains little relating population family planning. Instead, document dominated wordy phrases necessity attaining social economic development countries. Will insight family planning programs work efficiently integral part programs social economic development country lead programs realized? There every reason doubt plan Action effect. The reasons underdevelopment Third World countries cannot removed United Nations resolutions. In Peoples Republic China, family planning widely accepted, especially towns, also among rural population. Limiting number children considered part Chinas development effort. China less-developed country process rapid social economic development. The issue stake Third World countries achieve similar development. As soon goal achieved, family planning efforts meaningful chance success. The experience China demonstrates even took time efforts succeeded. There many Third World countries could, without much difficulty, support population considerably larger present one. But doubt also number countries population already large continued population increase would harmful. The need achieve rapid development becomes increasingly urgent, least make possible attain reduced population growth. The sad truth little development takes place countries. Without social economic development, present rapid population increase continue countries already overly dense population
