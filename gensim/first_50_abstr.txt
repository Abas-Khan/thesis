The interaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with hydrogen peroxide: inactivation of the enzyme.Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase slowly irreversibly inactivated hydrogen peroxide. The rate inactivation directly dependent upon concentrations H2O2 enzyme, second-order rate constant pH 10.0 25 degrees 6.7 M-1 sec-1. Inactivation preceded bleaching due rapid reduction Cu2+ enzyme, following gradual reappearance new absorption visible region, coincident loss catalytic activity. Inactivation enzyme pH-dependent indicated essential ionization whose pKa approximately 10.2. Replacement H2O D2O raised pKa diminish catalytic activity superoxide dismutase, measured pH 10.0.

The homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited CD spectra similar shape sign native antibody molecules although recombinant molecules longer stabilized interchain disulfide bonds. Upon addition hexasaccharide ligand, significant decrease amplitude CD spectra (18-21%) occurred three native antibodies Fab fragments well homologous recombinant molecules. No CD spectral changes could detected upon interaction hapten ligand heterologous recombinants.

Conformational changes induced in a homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal antibody by oligosaccharides of increasing size.The circular polarization luminescence (CPL) emitted tryptophan residues used sensitive probe measuring ligand-induced structural changes homogeneous type III pneumococcal antibody. A series oligosaccharide ligands increasing size derived type III polysaccharide partial acid hydrolysis assayed. Ligand-induced changes circular polarization fluorescence antibody observed antigens tested, including tetra-, hexa-, octasaccharides 16-residue oligomer, largest changes recorded upon interaction intact soluble type III pneumococcal (SIII) polysaccharide. When Fab' F(ab')2 fragments used instead antibody IgG binding SIII polysaccharide, extent conformational changes decreased. This suggests interactions Fab Fc portions IgG molecule subsequent conformational changes Fc part upon antigen binding. Reduction interchain disulfide bonds abolished additional spectral changes attributed Fc part changes observed Fab part, thus suggesting presence interchain disulfide bond hinge region required maximal CPL changes occur. Small monovalent ligands, i.e., tetra-, hexa-, octasaccharides, capable inducing CPL changes Fab part antibody molecule well CPL changes attributed Fc portion. A multivalent ligand containing 16 sugar residues appears minimal antigenic size required triggering conformational changes attributed Fc part, similar seen interaction whole polysaccharide antigen.
Evidence of the involvement of a 50S ribosomal protein in several active sites.The functional role Bacillus stearothermophilus 50S ribosomal protein B-L3 (probably homologous Escherichia coli protein L2) examined chemical modification. The complex [B-L3-23S RNA] photooxidized presence rose bengal modified protein incorporated reconstitution 50S ribosomal subunits containing unmodified components. Particles containing photooxidized B-L3 defective several functional assays, including (1) poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis, (2) peptidyltransferase activity, (3) ability associate [30S-poly(U)-Phe-tRNA] complex, (4) binding elongation factor G GTP. The rates loss partial functional activities photooxidation B-L3 indicate least two independent inactivating events occurring, faster one, involving oxidation one histidine residues, affecting peptidyltransferase subunit association activities slower one affecting EF-G binding. Therefore protein B-L3 one histidine residues essential peptidyltransferase subunit association, another residue essential EF-G-GTP binding. B-L3 may ribosomal peptidyltransferase protein, part active site, may contribute functional groups active sites well.
The interaction of phospholipase A2 with micellar interfaces. The role of the N-terminal region.The localization previously postulated interface recognition site (IRS) porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, required specific interaction enzyme organized lipid-water interfaces, investigated ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, measurements intrinsic fluorescence unique Trp residue, protection experiments specific tryptic hydrolysis.

Besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute binding process. At neutral acidic pH presence salt bridge N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group negatively charged side chain stablizes interface recognition site allows enzyme penetrate micellar surfaces, even absence metal ion. At alkaline pH, interaction enzyme micellar interfaces requires presence Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions.

Constitution and properties of axonal membranes of crustacean nerves.The purification axonal membranes crustaceans followed measuring enrichment [3H]tetrodotoxin binding capacity Na+, K+-ATPase activity. A characteristic membranes high content lipids low content protein compared types plasmatic membranes. The axonal membrane contains myosin-like, actin-like, tropomyosin-like, tubulin-like proteins. It also contains Na+, K+-ATPase acetylcholinesterase. The molecular weights two enzymes solubilization 280,000 270,000, respectively. The molecular weights catalytic subunits 96,000 ATPase 71,000 acetylcholinesterase. We confirmed presence nicotine binding component axonal membrane lobster unable find [3H]nicotine binding crab axonal membranes. The binding axonal membranes og sodium channel, studied detail. The dissociation constant binding [3H]tetrodotoxin axonal membrane receptor 2.9 nM pH 7.4. The concentration tetrodotoxin receptor crustacean membranes 10 pmol/mg membrane protein, 7 times less acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less Na+, K+-ATPase, 30 times less nicotine binding component lobster membrane.

Nitrogenase levels new mutants presence NH4+ high 100% nitrogenase activity detected absence NH4+. 3. Biochemical characterization nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals fall three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 29), requiring glutamate growth, synthesize nitrogenase glutamine synthetase constitutively (in presence NH4+). A second class mutants (strains SK-27 37) requiring glutamine growth produces derepressed levels nitrogenase activity synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, determined immunologically. A third class glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 26) synthesizes neither catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map segment Klebsiella chromosome corresponding region coding glutamine synthetase. Since mutant strains SK-27 SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, concluded mutations map within glutamine synthetase structural gene.
