Identification of chloride-binding sites in hemoglobin by nuclear-magnetic-resonance quadrupole-relaxation studies of hemoglobin digests.35Cl minus-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicate various digests human hemoglobin carboxypeptidase A B, combination two, may used identification chloride binding sites. All digestion products contain, like hemoglobin itself, least two classes binding sites, one high, others low affinity. The pH dependence excess linewidth 35Cl minus NMR signal indicates simple digests either carboxypeptidase A B, chloride bound high affinity near His-beta146-Asp-beta94 near Val-alpha1-Arg-alpha141. The high-affinity sites show, case simple digests, strong oxygen linkage lost forms digested carboxypeptidase A B; linkage may thus correlated presence conformational changes. Organic phosphates, like inositol hexaphosphate, show competition high-affinity chloride binding sites hemoglobin simple digests. This competition likewise lost doubly digested hemoglobins.

Chromosomal basis of the merozygosity in a partially deploid mutant of Pneumococcus.A sulfonamide-resistant mutant pneumococcus, sulr-c, displays genetic instability, regularly segregating wild type. DNA extracts derivatives strain possess transforming activities mutant wild-type alleles, establishing strain partial diploid. The linkage sulr-c strr-61, stable chromosomal marker, established, thus defining chromosomal locus sulr-c. DNA isolated sulr-c cells transforms two mutant recipient strains low efficiency wild-type recipient, although mutant property strains makes capable integrating classical "low-efficiency" donor markers equally efficiently "high efficiency" markers. Hence sulr-c must different basis low efficiency classical low efficiency point mutations. We suggest DNA region sulr-c mutation structural abnormality leads frequent segregation growth difficulty efficiently mediating genetic transformation.
Recombination as a requirement for segregation of a partially diploid mutant of Pneumococcus.Conditions described pneumococcal mutant strain sulr-c, resistant drug sulfanilamide, gives rise sensitive segregants resistant nitrobenzoic acid frequency constant time. This segregant frequency markedly enhanced upon exposure cells doses ultraviolet light mitomycin C permit survival 50% 90% cells. Treatment acridine orange diminishes segregant frequency. From known influences three agents genetic recombination, propose recombination event necessary generation segregants.--During period incubation following treatment ultraviolet light mitomycin C, cell division resumes original segregant frequency restored. Thus potential segregants either unable replicate absence selection, under-represented among cells dividing soon treatment.--If sulr-c mutation introduced mutant pneumococcal strain lacking ATP-dependent exonuclease activity deficient recombination transforming DNA, segregant frequencies unaffected. This fact may indicate limits upon type recombination event responsible segregation.

Consequences of altering the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding site.Hemoglobin Deer Lodge abnormal human hemoglobin arginine substituted histidine beta 2 position. X-ray crystallography normal human hemoglobin shown beta 2 residue normally part binding site 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The substitution arginine histidine beta 2 affects kinetics equilibria ligand binding. When stripped anions, Hb Deer Lodge increased oxygen affinity decreased degree cooperativity relative Hb A. The alkaline Bohr effect slightly increased marked increases oxygen affinity pH 6 pH 8. In presence 2,3-diphosphoglycerate cooperativity increases nromal pH dependence oxygen binding reduced. This contrasts enhanced Bohr effect seen Hb A presence organic phosphates. Due enhanced anion binding high pH, Hb Deer Lodge slightly lower oxygen affinity Hb A pH 9 presence 2,3-diphosphoglycerate inositol hexaphosphate. Kinetic studies neutral pH absence organic phosphates revealed biphasicity rate oxygen dissociation Hb Deer Lodge, approximately linear time courses observed Hb A. The fast phase oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, organic phosphates increase rate percentage fast phase without greatly affecting slow phase. The two phases resolvable high pH. CO combination kinetics much like Hb A except "fast" "slow" phases apparent wavelengths near deoxy-CO isobestic point. We suggest functional differences alpha beta chains enhanced Hb Deer Lodge. After flash photolysis CO derivative, percentage quickly reacting material slightly greater Hb Deer Lodge Hb A. This may imply somewhat greater tendency dissociate high affinity subunits. The substitution arginine histidine beta 2 thus results macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties significantly altered, primary differences expressed high pH Hb Deer Lodge binds anions strongly Hb A. The properties Hb Deer Lodge compared hemoglobin variants substitutions residues involved binding 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.

The method depends availability lipids whose fatty acids odd-chained therefore suitable internal reference compounds that, time lipid extraction, added incubation permit subsequent quantification content free fatty acids fatty acids esterified specific lipids. We found four types lipolytic activities human platelets. In homogenates pH 4.0 triglyceride lipase operated shown synchrony triglyceride degradation release glycerol fatty acids predominant constituents triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid released pH level suggest phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts acid. With membranous preparations, alkaline pH range two peaks fatty acid release accompanying degradation phospholipids. At pH 8.5, release saturated acids, palmitic stearic, predominated, sum 3.5 times arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 release palmitic stearic acids slightly peak values; however, release arachidonic acid nearly equaled sum saturated acids. Linoleic acid released representative amounts reactions released arachidonic acid, despite overwhelming propensity esterified 2-position phospholipids. Pertinently, choline phospholipids linoleic-rich non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, generous endowment arachidonic acid. With mind, raise possibility phospholipase A2 human platelets endoenzyme tendency act phospholipids thought comprise inner layer cell membrane.

Dependence on dose of the acute effects of ethanol on liver metabolism in vivo.The dose dependence acute effects ethanol upon liver intermediary metabolism vivo demonstrated rats. Ethanol given i.p. doses 0.69, 1.7, 3.0 g/kg equal volumes (20 ml/kg). The liver freeze-clamped 120 min injection, multiple metabolites measured perchloric acid extract tissue. Each group showed significantly different pattern metabolites, redox states, phosphorylation potentials although rate ethanol disappearance, least two highest dose groups, significantly different. The mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] ratios cytoplasmic free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio paradoxically reduced lowest dose ethanol became progressively oxidized increasing dose. Once established, differences ratios groups tended persist time, relatively independent concentration ethanol. In somewhat different pattern, phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP][P1]) remained control level low-dose group significantly elevated two higher-dose groups. The results, therefore, show distinct complicated dose-dependent patterns intermediary metabolism cannot explained completely one hypothesis imply significant dose-dependent effects ethanol upon intermediary metabolism directly related NADH production.

Factors affecting the solubility of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals.The solubility triclinic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals measured varying conditions using 45Ca-labeled crystals, expressing solubility micromoles per liter 45Ca solution. In 0.1-M Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7.4, solubility accurately sized CPPD crystals (37-20mum) 60muM maximal solubility attained 8 h incubation 37degreeC. Reduction crystal size, decrease pH, increase ionic strength, Mg++, citrate, albumin increased solubility. The marked effects solubility occurred changing calcium concentration enzymatic hydrolysis inoganic pyrophosphate orthophosphate. It found decreasing ionized calcium level 5 mg/100 ml resulted progressive enhancement solubility. The observed solubility-enhancing effects albumin could explained solely calcium-binding ability thereby, altered ionized calcium level. Diffusible calcium synovial fluid 40% total calcium concentration, means joint fluids normally near critical concentration 5 mg/100 ml ionized calcium, solubility enhanced. During surgery, especially parathyroidectomy, calcium levels fall, favoring dissolution CPPD crystals. We speculate slight decrease crystal size dissolution frees cartilaginous mold, resulting dose-dependent inflammatory reaction "shed" joint space. Crystal shedding may reinforced modest fall joint fluid pH accompanying inflammatory response.

How do biological systems discriminate among physically similar ions?This paper reviews history understanding biological systems discriminate strikingly among physically similar ions, especially alkali cations. Appreciation qualitative regularities ("permitted sequences") quantitative regularities ("selectivity isotherms") ion selectivity grew first studies ion exchangers glass electrodes, biological systems enzymes cell membranes, recently lipid bilayers doped model pores carriers. Discrimination ions depends electrostatic steric forces. "Black-box" studies intact biological membranes cases yielded molecular clues structure actual biological pores carriers. Major current problems involve extraction molecules; it, achieved, (and if) relevant central problems membrane function. Further advances expected soon studies rate barriers within membranes, voltage-dependent ("excitable") conducting channels, increasingly complex model systems biological membranes.
Photoreceptor processes: some problems and perspectives.Visual photoreceptors vertebrates invertebrates characterized extensive elaboration membrane contains visual pigment (rhodopsin). Visual pigments phyla examined chemically similar: chromophore 11-cis retinaldehyde attached aldimine linkage (Schiff base) membrane protein, opsin. The effect light isomerize chromophore all-trans configuration. Beyond fundamental similarities, several specific areas discussed variations differences appear. (1) Light causes vertebrate visual pigments bleach, liberating chromophore. Most invertebrate visual pigments bleach light, instead form thermally stable metarhodopsin, chromophore all-trans configuration still attached opsin. (2) In disk membranes vertebrate rod cone outer segments, rhodopsin molecules oriented chromophores nearly coplanar disks. Within plane, however, rotational translational diffusion possible. In microvillar membranes arthropod cephalopod rhabdoms, hand, situation less clear. There evidence preferential orientation chromophores implies restrictions Brownian rotation. (3) In outer segments vertebrate receptors, absorption light rhodopsin causes plasma membrane hyperpolarize due decrease sodium conductance, possibly mediated calcium ions. In invertebrate photoreceptors, light causes depolarization due increase conductance, principally sodium ions. A subsequent entry calcium causes partial repolarization membrane, due decrease sodium conductance. (4) For vertebrate receptors, log threshold directly proportional fraction rhodopsin bleached (Dowling-Rushton relationship). The proportionality constant varies different preparations less four 30, physical basis relationship unknown. For invertebrates, contrast, dependence sensitivity rhodopsin concentration much less dramatic may well depend simply probability quantum catch. (5) In species, vertebrate invertebrate, accumulation photoproduct probably effect membrane conductance, several possible exceptions exist. (6) Photoregeneration rhodopsin metarhodopsin likely important mechanism recovery certain arthropods diurnal insects, dark mechanisms recovery also exist phyla. In single case adequately understood.

Renal response to acid loading in the developing lamb fetus, intact in utero.Response fetal kidney metabolic acidosis studied five fetal lambs, 115-125 days gestation, order evaluate renal contribution elimination hydrogen ion intra-uterine development. Experiments conducted healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact utero, catheters implanted hysterotomy fetal femoral artery vein bladder via urachus, four days prior study. A metabolic acidosis induced infusion isotonic lactic acid, 15 mole/kg, intravenously period 90 minutes. Serial arterial samples taken urine collected fractions before, three hours following infusion, measurements pH, bicarbonate, lactate electrolytes well urine output. During infusion, urine pH fell 6.65 6.25 6.34 three hours later (Figs. 1 4, Tabs. III IV). Lactic acid infusion caused prompt increase urine output mean rate 0.12 maximum 0.28 ml/kg/min end infusion, returning control rates three hours later. Lactate excretion increased 0.05 maximum 4.6 mumole/kg/min end infusion; titratable acid increased 0.22 maximum 4 muEq/kg/min; rates excretion lactate titratable acid still higher control end three hours. Ammonia excretion increased 0.21 maximum 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours end infusion. The acid infusion caused small significant fall excretion bicarbonate. During 90 minutes infusion following three hours, 800 mumole lactate excreted net acid excretion period half amount. The diuresis also accompanied net loss sodium chloride, excretion ions increasing threefold following acid infusion; excretion potassium decreased one-third rate prior infusion. During 90 minutes infusion, blood pH fell 7.36 7.13, base deficit rose 3.8 16.4 mEq/L lactate rose 2.2 14.8 mM/L; also small significant rise blood PCO2 PO2 (Figs. 1 2, Tabs. I II). During following three hours recovery, pH rose gradually 7.29, base deficit lactate fell 7.4 mEq/L 8.7 mM/L respectively. Since renal excretion net acid lactate small, decrease blood base deficit lactate levels recovery must therefore mainly due equilibration various fetal compartments well placental transfer. These experiments indicate that, lamb fetus, intact utero, kidney although limited immaturity several mechanisms, capable responding acid load thus make small contribution fetal homeostasis. The increase excretion net acid accompanied loss sodium chloride urine.

Studies on the mechanism of depletion of striatal dopamine by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine.These experiments designed study mechanism depletion dopamine (DA) striatum produced alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine (alpha-MMT). alpha-Methyl-m-tyramine (alpha-MMTA), metabolite alpha-MMT, appears active DA-depleting agent, since administration decarboxylase inhibitor alpha-MMT markedly reduced formation alpha-MMTA depletion DA. After injection alpha-MMT (100 mg/kg i.p.), striatal concentration homovanillic acid (HVA) rose 41% 1 hour. This probably due increase DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced decline DA produced alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). At 2, 3 4 hours alpha-MMT, concentration HVA dihydroxyphenylacetic acid control level. The decrease dihydroxyphenylacetic acid due partially decreased formation dihydroxyphenylacetic acid DA. In striatal slices, alpha-MMT alpha-MMTA decreased formation 3H-H2O accumulation 3H-DA 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine. Alpha-MMT alter specific activity 3H-tyrosine release 3H-DA slices, inhibit activity tyrosine hydroxylase striatal homogenates low concentrations tyrosine (10 muM). Alpha-MMTA released newly synthesized exogenously accumulated 3H-DA striatal slices. At low concentrations alpha-MMTA, percent reduction 3H-H2O much greater percentage 3H-DA released medium. However, higher concentrations, inhibition 3H-H2O reached maximum 3H-DA release kept increasing. These results suggest inhibition tyrosine hydroxylase activity DA release storage sites alpha-MMTA may account depletion DA produced injection alpha-MMT.

The influence of pH on equilibrium effects of tetrodotoxin on myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta.1. The experiments done single nodes Ranvier Rana esculenta. The effects tetrodotoxin H ions determined either reduction maximum rate rise, VA, action potentials evoked threshold stimuli voltage clamp decrease peak Na permeability, PNa. 2. With tetrodotoxin sample used throughout investigation equilibrium dissociation constant, KT, toxin-receptor reaction neutral pH determined 2-8 nM. Between 1-55 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin normalized value, A, VA, found related normalized toxin concentration cT = [TTX]/2-8 nM empirical equation log [(1-A)/A] = 1-22 log cT-0-573. 3. On increasing pH (up 8-8) effect tetrodotoxin diminished revealed increase A. The apparent reduction cT (as calculated A) suggests toxin active cationic forms. 4. Weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions (7-3 less pH less equal 5-5) reduced A lesser degree neutral toxin solutions spite inherent depressing effect acid pH A (A = 0-5 pH 5-5). In acid toxin solutions A decreased pH 4-6 equal value toxin-free solution. 5. When, equilibrium acid toxin solution, perfusate suddenly changed neutral Ringer solution A jumped higher value A' measured 1 sec switch. Since blocking effect hydrogen ions subsided within fraction second time constant toxin washout order 1 min, A' reflects number Na channels blocked tetrodotoxin acid pH. 6. In acid toxin-free solution peak PNa obtained voltage clamp experiments reduced voltage-dependent factor (cH + 1)-1 CH = [H+]/KH(E) KH(E) = 2-04 muM exp (0-34 EF/RT). Adding tetrodotoxin resulted another reduction constant factor p'T. 7. Experiments employing various combinations toxin concentration (3-1-93 nM) pH values (7-3-5-2) confirm decreased toxin effect low pH. Moreover, p'T smaller (the additional toxin effect larger) membrane kept depolarized thus cH reduced equilibration. This suggests tetrodotoxin cations H ions compete blocking site. A quantitative fit, however, requires additional assumptions.

VA measurements showed alkaline solutions (pH 8-8) offset rate unchanged onset slowed quantitative agreement assumed decrease active cationic form tetrodotoxin. 3. Both VA measurements voltage clamp revealed decrease T'off, offset time constant increase onset time constant, T'on, pH lowered. 4. For tetrodotoxin concentrations, [TTX], 400 nM pH values 5-3 simple relation T'on/T'off = p'R held, p'T constant factor Na permeability reduced equilibrium given [TTX]. 5. The agreement kinetic equilibrium results also valid when, constant [TTX] pH. p'T modified holding potential equilibration. 6. No unequivocal explanation results given features resemble acid catalysis.

Mechanism of action of penicillin: triggering of the pneumococcal autolytic enzyme by inhibitors of cell wall synthesis.During penicillin treatment autolysin defective mutant pneumococcus observed three novel phenomena: (i) Growth mutant cultures inhibited concentrations penicillin induce lysis wild type. (ii) Mutant bacteria treated minimum growth inhibitory concentration penicillin lyse upon addition wild-type autolysin growth medium. Chloramphenicol inhibitors protein synthesis protect cells lysis exogenous enzyme. Sensitivity cells exogenous autolysin requires treatment penicillin inhibitors cell wall synthesis (e.g., D-cycloserine fosfonomycin) since exogenous autolysin alone effect bacterial growth. (iii) Treatment penicillin (or inhibitors cell wall synthesis) causes escape medium choline-containing macromolecule properties suggesting contains pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid (Forssman antigen). Each one three phenomena (growth inhibition, sensitization exogenous autolysin, leakage lipoteichoic acid) shows dose response penicillin-induced lysis wild-type pneumococci. On basis findings propose new hypothesis mechanism penicillin-induced lysis bacteria. It suggested inhibition cell wall synthesis means triggers bacterial autolytic enzymes destabilizing endogenous complex autolysin inhibitor (lipoteichoic acid) autolytic enzyme. Escape lipoteichoic acid-like material growth medium consequence labilization. Chloramphenicol protects bacteria penicillin-induced lysis interfering activity autolytic enzyme, rather depleting concentration enzyme cell surface.

Role of cardiovascular and ionic changes in pathogenesis and prevention of isoprenaline-induced cardiac necrosis.Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen uptake, blood values PO2, PCO2, pH studied unanesthetized rats 8 hours. After cardiotoxic dose 20 mg/kg isoprenaline, s.c., blood pressure fell 117 72 mm Hg, heart rate accelerated 326 497 beats/minute, cardiac work diminished 15%. Metabolic rate increased 80%, blood values PO2 rose, PCO2 fell somewhat, whereas blood pH dropped 7.48 7.38, indicating metabolic acidosis. Propranolol (40 mg/kg, i.p.) verapamil (50 mg/kg, i.p.), almost completely prevented isoprenaline-induced cardiac necroses, inhibited chronotropic calorigenic actions isoprenaline 50%. While propranolol inhibited depressor effect isoprenaline completely, verapamil enhanced it: blood pressure fell 46 mm Hg. Isoprenaline-induced fall blood pH prevented either propranolol verapamil. Decrease blood pH cardionecrotisation enhanced isoprenaline given together 4.8 g/kg ethanol, p.o. In conclusion, hemodynamic actions isoprenaline, especially hypotension, seem nonessential production cardiac necroses. Strong acidification aggravate cardiotoxicity isoprenaline.
Alterations in norepinephrine pattern in the damaged myocardium in the rat.In albino rat, evolvement myocardial necrosis induced single injection ISO accompanied fall total NE. Pretreatment propranolol pargyline protected ISO-induced necrosis myocardial hypertrophy, influence ISO-induced depletion NE stores.

Protective effect of hypothermia in cerebral oxygen deficiency caused by arterial hypoxia.To study cerebral protective effects hypothermia arterial hypoxia, anesthetized (70% N2O), mechanically ventilated rats cooled body temperature 27 C. Hypoxia induced decreasing oxygen content inspired gas mixture either 6-7 per cent 2.5-3 per cent. This reduced mean PaO2 25 11-12 torr, respectively. At PaO2 torr, change cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrla oxygen consumption (CMRO2), labile tissue metabolites. The absence signs cerebral hypoxia could attributed effect temperature pH hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. Thus, 27 C PaO2 25 torr total oxygen content (TO2) arterial blood remained greater 15 ml (100 ml)-1, three times value obtained PO2 normothermic rats. At PaO2 11-12 torr, arterial TO2 reduced 5 ml (100 ml) (-1). The hypoxia induced change CMRO2, threefold increase CBF, moderate lactacidosis tissue, small decrease phosphocreatine content, change ATP, ADP, AMP. These changes less marked occurring arterial TO2 normothermic rats. It concluded hypothermia exerts pronounced protective effect brain hypoxic hypoxia, two mechanisms involved. First, since hypothermia shifts oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve towards left, prevents minimizes rightward shift due acidosis, maintains high TO2 arterial blood given PaO2. Second, reducing CMRO2, thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements, hypothermia exerts protective effect cellular level.

The pH-dependence and group modification of beta-lactamase I.The pH-dependence kinetic parameters hydrolysis beta-lactam ring beta-lactamase I (penicillinase, EC 3.5.2.6) studied. Benzylpenicillin ampicillin (6-[D(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido]penicillanic acid) used. Both kcat. kcat./Km substrates gave bell-shaped plots parameter versus pH. The pH-dependence kcat./Km two substrates gave value (8.6) higher apparent pK, value may characterize group free enzyme; lower apparent pK values 5(4.85 benzylpenicillin, 5.4 ampicillin). For benzylpenicillin kcat. kcat./Km depended pH exactly way. The value Km benzylpenicillin thus independent pH, suggesting ionization enzyme's catalytically important groups affect binding substrate. The pH-dependence kcat. ampicillin differed, however, presumably polar group side chain. The hypothesis pK5 group carboxyl group tested. Three reagents normally react preferentially carboxyl groups inactivated enzyme: reagents Woodward's reagent K, water-soluble carbodi-imide, triethyloxonium fluoroborate. These findings tend support idea carboxylate group plays part action beta-lactamase I.
